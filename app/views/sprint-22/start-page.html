      <p class="govuk-body">Energy for Schools helps state-funded schools and
        trusts switch to the same energy contract used by the Department for
        Education.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">Schools and trusts that use the service are added to
        the Department for Education's energy contract with Crown Commercial
        Service (CCS). The CCS buys energy for this particular contract over a
        long period of time, reducing the risk to customers of substantial
        fluctuations in price.</p>
      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Benefits</h2>
      <p class="govuk-body">Schools could save on average 36% on their energy
        bills, based on DfE's estimates. The service also helps:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>protect schools from market volatility and high prices</li>
        <li>save time spent on procurement process</li>
        <li>remove risk associated with unregulated energy brokers</li>
        <li>comply with procurement regulations</li>
      </ul>
      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">How to join</h2>
      <p class="govuk-body">Individual state-funded schools, like local
        authority-maintained schools and single academy trusts, can join Energy
        for Schools using the online service.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">Multi-academy trusts can join by repeating the
        online process for each school that's switching to the energy contract.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">Alternatively, MATs can fill in the <a href="https://submit.forms.service.gov.uk/preview-live/8895/multi-academy-trusts-register-your-interest-in-energy-for-schools/1049539" class="govuk-link">
        Register your interest form</a> and complete the paperwork
        offline. This may benefit MATs that are ready to switch 8 or more
        schools to the energy deal.</p>
