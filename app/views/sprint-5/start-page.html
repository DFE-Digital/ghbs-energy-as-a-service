      <p>Energy for Schools helps state-funded schools and trusts switch to the same energy contract used by the Department for Education.</p>
      <p>Schools and trusts that use the service are added to the Department for Education’s energy contract with Crown Commercial Service (CCS). The CCS buys energy for this particular contract over a long period of time, reducing the risk to customers of substantial fluctuations in price. </p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">
