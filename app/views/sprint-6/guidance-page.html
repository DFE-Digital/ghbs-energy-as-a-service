      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">About Energy for Schools</h2>
      <p>Energy for Schools offers schools a simpler, safer way to manage their energy needs by helping schools switch to the same energy contract as the Department for Education (DfE).</p>
      <p>DfE manages the contract on behalf of schools through procurement specialists Crown Commercial Service (CCS). On the current contract, called V30, electricity is supplied by EDF, and gas is supplied by TotalEnergies.</p>
      <p>This service differs to other frameworks because it allows schools to benefit from the bulk purchasing power of a government-wide contract. It also saves schools from pouring over complex energy contracts because DfE handles the paperwork.</p>

     
      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Benefits</h3>
      <p>All central government departments are on the V30 contract to compliantly procure their energy supply.</p>
      <p>Customers are protected from market volatility and soaring prices because the CCS buys some of the energy up front, during the 30 months prior to delivery, and then during the delivery period itself. This helps to level out the peaks and troughs in price variances.</p>
      <p>V30 could save schools money on their bills. According to a price comparison exercise carried out by DfE, schools could’ve saved on average up to 36% on their energy bills in the financial year ending 2024 had they been on the V30 contract.</p>
      <p>If your school joins Energy for Schools, DfE will handle certain contractual responsibilities and administrative paperwork with the new energy suppliers.</p>

      <p class="govuk-body">This means schools</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>save time by using our simplified onboarding process</li>
        <li>don’t have to deal with complex energy contracts</li>
        <li>are exempt from the usual requirements around procurement</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Unlike brokers, this process is free to access and use.</p>

      <div id="v30"></div>
      <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">V30 contract</h3>

      <p>V30 is a low-risk variable rate contract.</p>
      <p>Prices can go up and down, but changes are less drastic than other variable rates. It’s the most stable variable rate contract available to schools, although it may not always give you the lowest price.</p>
      <p>CCS cannot provide potential customers with energy prices before they join due to commercial sensitivity.</p>
      <p>To get an estimate of prices, email <a href="#" class="govuk-link">dfe-energy.services-team@education.gov.uk</a> and request DfE’s benchmarking service. We’ll provide a price comparison based on your energy bills from the last financial year.</p>
      <p>V30 is a rolling contract, meaning your school will remain on the contract until you give notice to exit. 30 months’ notice is required.</p>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Start date</h3>
      <p>New customers are added to the V30 contract every April. Your application date and current contract’s expiry date will determine which year you’ll join.</p>

      <p>Check your current contract's termination terms and notice period. You'll need to serve out your notice period and inform your supplier if you join Energy for Schools. DfE cannot do this for you.</p>
      <p>If your school’s energy contract is already through CCS, DfE will transfer (novate) you onto the new account. In this instance, you’ll not need to give notice to your current supplier.</p>


      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Interim rate</h3>
      <p>An interim rate contract is a temporary arrangement. You’ll be placed on an interim rate if there’s a gap between your current contract’s expiry date and the next available start date for the V30 contract.</p>
      <p>For example, if your current contract ends on 31 December 2025 and you start your new V30 contract on 1 April 2026, you’ll be on an interim rate between 1 January 2026 and 31 March 2026.</p>
      <p>You'll still benefit from all framework protections, including procurement compliance, social value commitments and data security measures.</p>
      <p>Interim rates are available on request. They are similar to the V30 rate but may vary due to market conditions.</p>
      <p>If you apply to Energy for Schools and need to go on an interim rate for electricity, the supplier EDF will inform you of prices within 6 weeks of completing the online form.</p>
      <p>For gas, you should receive interim prices from the supplier TotalEnergies roughly 30 days prior to receiving supply.</p>
      <p>We'll automatically move you onto the V30 contract when your interim contract ends.</p>
      <p>If you’re out of contract and need an immediate energy supply, you’ll be placed on interim rates.</p>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Billing</h3>
      <p>Energy for Schools is a contract and not a procurement process. By joining, you’ll be switching to the CCS framework used by DfE.</p>
      <p>The CCS framework complies with the Public Contracts Regulation 2015, the legislation in place at the time the framework was established. It is therefore procurement compliant. Any future changes to the CCS framework will comply with the new Procurement Act.</p>
      <p>Schools joining the framework will have complied with DfE’s Buying Procedures and Procurement Law for Schools. </p>
      <p>That means you're exempt from the procurement protocol of securing 3 quotes or going out to market.</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Considerations</h2>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">VAT declaration</h3>
      <p>You’ll be asked to declare your VAT status when joining Energy for Schools. This is to ensure you’re charged the correct amount of VAT on your energy supplies.</p>
      <p>If you’re unsure how much VAT you’re currently charged for gas and electricity, check with your tax advisor. If you’re a local authority-maintained school, check with your local authority.</p>


      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Renewable energy</h3>
      <p>The energy supply is from the supplier’s standard ‘Brown’ product. Everyone who uses this supply gets between 30-40% renewable energy through the UK power grid. This percentage is increasing as more renewable energy sources are added to the grid.</p>
      <p>You can choose to pay more for a product that contains more renewable energy. Email<a href="#" class="govuk-link">dfe-energy.services-team@education.gov.uk</a> to discuss renewable options.</p>
      <p>Energy savings made through renewable energy, such as solar panels, are not factored into this contract. You should continue your current arrangement or contact EDF about setting up a Smart Export Guarantee if you wish to export energy back to the grid.</p>

      <div id="how-to-join"></div>
      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">How to join</h2>

      <p>State-funded schools and trusts in England that want to switch to the contract can do so by filling in <a href="#" class="govuk-link">an online form.</a></p>
      <p>Depending on which supply you’re switching, you’ll need to provide:</p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>your contract end date</li>
        <li>who your supplier is</li>
        <li>how many meters you have on site, and their numbers (MPRN/ MPAN)</li>
        <li>estimated annual usage per meter in kwh</li>
        <li>How much VAT you pay and your VAT registration number, if applicable</li>
      </ul>

      <p>DfE will share your information with the new suppliers and send you a confirmation email with details of what happens next.</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Objections</h2>
      <p>In some cases, the current energy supplier may raise an objection to switching contracts. Common reasons for objections include unpaid invoices, incorrect meter numbers or insufficient notice given to terminate the current contract.</p>
      <p>DfE will inform you if an objection is raised. You’ll need to contact your existing supplier to resolve the issue and switch contracts – DfE does not have the authority to do this for you.</p>
